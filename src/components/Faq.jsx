      Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
      <h5>HOW DO I PLACE AN ORDER?</h5>
      <p>
        From our Homepage, select the items you are interested in. Select color
        or size if applicable, and click ADD TO CART. When you are finished
        shopping, select CHECKOUT. Once your order is complete and your payment
        information is received, your selections will be shipped to you the same
        business day if it is made prior to 4:00PM EST for ground and 6:00PM EST
        for air. You will be notified as to the expected shipping date and
        tracking number information.

      <h5>MY CREDIT CARD WAS NOT APPROVED. WHY NOT?</h5>
      <p>
        The number one reason why credit cards are rejected is due to an AVS
        Mismatch. What this means is that the name and address you entered at
        CHECKOUT under BILLING ADDRESS do not match the address where the bank
        sends your credit card bill. Be sure and enter this information
        carefully, and check with your bank if you receive this error. Due to
        the amount of fraud on the internet, we have installed protection that
        will not allow more than 2 orders per IP address within a 24 hour
        period. If you need to place a third order, please contact us toll free
        at 877-241-0184 or internationally at 1-954-566-7300, and we would be
        happy to process your order.

      <h5>WHAT IF AN ITEM IS OUT OF STOCK?</h5>
      <p>
        If an item is out of stock, we will notify you with an approximate
        shipping date. In almost all cases even if an item is out of stock we
        can ship within 5 business days.
      </p>
      <h5>DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING?</h5>

        A shipping charge is included to handle packing and shipping costs. The
        amount to be charged is shown when you go to CHECKOUT.
