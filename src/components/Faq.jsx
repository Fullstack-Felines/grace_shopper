      Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
      <h5>WHAT DO YOUR ADOPTION FEES INCLUDE?</h5>
      <p>
        The adoption fee covers the animals spay/neuter, current vaccinations,
        heartworm testing/treatment, feline leukemia and FIV testing, and
        microchip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kittens (under 4 months) have been vaccinated against Distemper, Feline
        Leukemia and Feline AIDS tested, and fecal checked. They have been
        spayed/neutered. The Rabies Vaccination will be given when the kitten
        reaches 4 months. A neuter deposit may be necessary when adopting a
        kitten that is not yet spayed/neutered.

      <h5>IS IT DIFFICULT TO ADOPT?</h5>
      <p>
        We have policies for approving adoptions. They are designed to ensure
        that each animal is placed with a responsible person prepared to make a
        lifelong commitment, and to avoid the kinds of problems that may have
        caused the animal to be brought to the shelter in the first place. An
        important part of the process is to match the lifestyle and needs of the
        adopter with the individual dog or cat. If the screening process
        occasionally seems overly strict, try to remember that the shelter’s
        first priority is to protect the animal’s best interests.
      </p>
      <h5>ARE THERE REQUIREMENTS FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION?</h5>
      <p>
        Having a companion animal brings rewards and responsibilities. Following
        your pet’s adoption, you will be responsible for making sure your pet is
        safe and for providing regular veterinary care. Be sure your dog has
        appropriate identification. Provide nutritious food and fresh water for
        your pet. Make time for exercise, training, and play. Finally, enjoy
        your new life with your new loving companion.
      </p>
      <h5>WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS AFTER I GET MY NEW PET HOME?</h5>
      <p>
        We understand that after you get our pet home, the adjustment period can
        be difficult. We encourage you to call us with any questions or
        problems, hopefully, before small problems become big ones! We are very
        experienced with pet transitions and welcome the opportunity to help
        make it as smooth for you and your pet as possible. And even when all is
        going well, we love getting calls just to know how our “alumni” are
        doing.
