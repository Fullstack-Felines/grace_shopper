        Meet Gary Roberts, proud owner of Pet World. At the age of 7, Gary knew
        he wanted to own a pet store. Then at the age of 13, he started working
        for a bird breeder, cleaning and caring for the birds. Working for the
        breeder taught him how to breed birds, which he began doing in his
        backyard aviary. He bred finches, canaries, parakeets, and cockatiels
        until he retired from bird breeding at age 15. A year later Gary got his
        first job at a local, central California pet store caring for the small
        animals, fish, and birds. By the time he was 19, he was working for two
        different pet stores. At 21 he started working for a pet supply
        distributor, selling pet supplies to pet stores, feed stores, vets, and
        groomers. He worked there until he was 25 and then began working for a
        pet supply manufacture selling to grocery stores and drug stores. Two
        years later, in 1992 Gary moved to Lakewood, from Santa Maria. He began
        working at Pet World, which at the time was owned by Dr. John Roscoe who
        started the business in 1985. Gary bought the store in 1996 and has
        owned it since. His mission was to keep it a small, locally owned and
        family operated store that focused on the health and happiness of his
        customer’s pets.

        Pet World has been focused on its customer’s critters for 32 years,
        making Pet World the oldest pet store in Jefferson County! In 1997 Gary
        welcomed his first daughter, Jordan, into the world. Many long-time
        customers watched Jordan grow up running around the store and playing
        with all the animals. In 2000 Gary welcomed his second daughter, Taylor,
        into the world. Those committed customers saw her grow up climbing the
        stacks of dog food and napping behind the counter. Three years later
        Gary had a son, Justin, who made all the customers smile with his chubby
        cheeks. Today you can find his three kids (almost) all grown up working
        for their dad, with the same passion for animals that Gary’s always had.
        At Pet World, we have experienced employees that are well versed in pet
        nutrition, pet care, and the products we carry. The majority of our
        employees have been with us for several years like Kelly who started in
        1999, working at Pet World after school. Her love for animals and
        dedication to hard work promoted her to the store manager in 2002.
        Becky, Kelly’s younger sister, joined her at Pet World in 2003 and has
        been a happy, helping employee since. And of course, our part-time
        employees round us out. They truly are animal lovers and experts, who
        genuinely care about the health, happiness, and well-being of your
        animals! Pet World is proud to offer our customers something that most
        of the larger pet food businesses cannot; superior quality, freshness,
        and good old-fashioned personalized service. We strive to offer a wide
        variety of high quality, safe, and affordable pet products.

        At Pet World, we focus on overall better nutrition to improve your pet’s
        health. We feel that Pet World is much more than “just another dog food
        store” but rather a place where you can learn the benefits of proper
        nutrition from our knowledgeable staff who are committed to providing
        you with options for pet nutrition. Pet World has been a leader in your
        companion’s diet since the beginning. From the biggest dog to the
        smallest hamster, we care about your pets’ health. Pet World specializes
        in hamsters, guinea pigs, birds, and fresh and saltwater fish. We also
        carry natural dog and cat foods, holistic pet treats, USA made pet toys,
        all the supplies you would ever need for your aquarium, and the freshest
        small animal and bird food you can find in the Denver Metro area.
